# CLE Assignment 1

## Description

The assignment goal was to develop a multithreaded implementation of the two general problems given in the practical classes.

The first exercise consisted...

 

**Course:** Large Scale Computing (2023/2024).

## Running the programs

### 1. Multithreaded equal consonants

- ...

#### Usage of the program

```

```

#### Example of usage

```...```

### 2. Multithreaded bitonic sort

- Run `cd prog2` to change to the program's directory.
- Run `make` to compile the program.
- Run `./prog2 REQUIRED OPTIONS` to run the program.

#### Usage of the program

```                                                                                          
REQUIRED:                                                                                                                   
-f --- input file with numbers                                                                                              
OPTIONS:                                                                                                                    
-h --- print this help                                                                                                      
-n --- number of worker threads (default is 2, minimum is 1)
```

#### Example of usage

```./prog2 -f data/datSeq256K.bin -n 8```
